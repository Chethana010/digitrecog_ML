## General Info
The MNIST dataset is one of the most common datasets used for image classification. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits, each of which is 28x28 pixels. This project utilizes a simple CNN model to classify these images.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
- Python 3.8
- TensorFlow 2.7.0
- Matplotlib 3.4.3

## Setup
To run this project, you need to install Python and the necessary Python packages. You can install the packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
```
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `main.py`:
```bash
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
python main.py
```
The program will train the model using the training data from the MNIST dataset, evaluate it using the test data, and then visualize some predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Implement data augmentation to increase model generalization.
- Explore different model architectures and hyperparameters.
- Add functionality to recognize digits from user-uploaded images.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit.
